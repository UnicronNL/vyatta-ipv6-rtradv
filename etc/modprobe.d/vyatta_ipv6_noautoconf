# By default, the system will attempt to acquire IPv6 addresses using
# stateless address auto-configuration (SLAAC) if IPv6 forwarding is
# disabled.  But we do not want auto-configuration to be done unless
# the user has explicitly configured it.  So, we set the autoconf
# module parameter to 0.  This can be over-ridden per-interface by
# writing "1" to /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/<ifname>/autoconf.
